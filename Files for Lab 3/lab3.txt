Type your solutions to the exercises in the lab handout 
(file F19_ECOR1051_Lab3.pdf) in this file.

==========
Exercise 1 

What is the name of the frame containing variable area_of_disk?
The name of the frame area_of_disk will be global frame
which is also the subject's name
What does variable area_of_disk refer to?
The variablearea_of-disk refer to the variable area whichis the function that gets the area.

What is the name of the frame containing parameter radius?
area_of_disk

When does the frame appear in the memory diagram?
The fourth step which refer to the code area = area_of_disk(5.0)

What is the type and value of the object bound to radius? What caused that
object to be bound to radius?
def area_of_disk(radius):
    return math.pi * radius ** 2 type of it is kind of math function
    with the function been added
    
How does PyTutor depict the value the function will return?
When the code shows that there is return has been shown

When does the frame containing radius disappear?
At the returning value been added in to the function

What is the name of the frame containing variable area? 
In the code def area_of_disk(radius):
	    return math.pi * radius ** 2
	name=frame_area_of_disk(radius)
When does area appear in the frame?
In the final step when plug the value area=area_of_desk(5.0) into the function

What is the type and value of the object bound to area? What caused that
object to be bound to area?
The function aded the value as radius and bound into the area.
with the value area = area_of_disk(5.0)

==========
Exercise 2 

What value does area_of_disk return each time it is called?
The first time area_of_disk value is the variable radius, and the radius is equal to 5.0
The second time this function value is (2.0+3.0)
The third time the function area = area_of_disk(r) ,give a variable r
In the fourth function gives the value r=5 also which is =to 2.0+3.0
==========
Exercise 3

What is the name of the frame containing parameters inner and outer?
The frame containing parameters inner is area_of_disk(inner)
The frame containing parameters outer is area_of_disk(outer)

When does the frame appear in the memory diagram?
At the start of the code
def area_of_ring(outer, inner), which gives out of def that shows the namespace of the variable of area of the inner/outer space of the ring

What are the types and values of the objects to inner and outer? 
inner type is tuple which is 5
outer type is tuple value is 10

What caused those objects to be bound to inner and outer?
By giving the def area_of_ring(outer, inner), and def area_of_disk(radius) this give the area of the inner and outer,
By using return gets the inner and outer area---return area_of_disk(outer) - area_of_disk(inner), so the object always boun to inner and outer

What is the name of the frame containing parameter radius? 
 def area_of_disk(radius):
       return math.pi * radius ** 2--this is the function


When does that frame appear in the memory diagram? How many times does it appear?
The frame appear in the diagram when def area_of_ring(outer, inner) and def area_of_disk(radius)


Each time the frame containing radius appears, what is the type and value of
the object bound to radius? What caused that object to be bound to radius?
The type of the frame containing appera is a kind of function about the radius also with the math dictionary been added.
With the function def area_of_disk(radius):
                      return math.pi * radius**2
                      # so the radius get into the function and become to the area of both inner and outer 

When does the frame containing radius disappear?
When the code goes onto return math.pi * radius ** 2 and finnally get the result

When does the frame containing inner and outer disappear?
At the finaly step which contain all the inner and outer together which get a value so the inner and outer will disappear

What is the name of the frame containing variable area? 
The frame contains the arguments given to the function, the function's local variables, and the address at which the function is executing.

When does area appear in the frame?
The area appera in the frame when 
area = area_of_ring(10.0, 5.0)

What is the type and value of the object bound to area? What caused that
object to be bound to area?
The type of the value of the object bound to area is function which is 
def area_of_disk(radius):
return math.pi * radius ** 2
with the code written as function outer - inner.

==========
Exercise 4 

Does area_of_disk automatically return the value of the expression 

    math.pi * radius ** 2

even though it isn't preceded by the keyword, return?  If not, what is the 
type and value of the object returned by the function?
No the value that area_of_disk get toward to the result.
without the return value the result that the area_of_disk does not get any kind of value.
The type of the objective is just that area radius which is 5.0

==========
Exercise 5

When cube is called, but before Python executes x = x ** 3, what value is bound
to parameter x? What value is bound to variable a?
The value that is bound to parameter x is just the function x = x ** 3 with x has the same value as a which is both 2
Variable a is bound to 2

After Python executes x = x ** 3, but before the function returns, what value
is bound to parameter x? What value is bound to variable a?
The value that is bound to parameter x is just the function x = x ** 3 with x has 2**3 = 8
a still has the value which is 2

In Python code, does assigning a value to a function parameter change the 
corresponding function argument?
In this type of Python code, it has change the corrsponding value which is a.
So it does change the argument, but nothing has chang for the function.
Without the return, the final out put is still a=2
